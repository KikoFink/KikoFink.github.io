<p>My name is Kristijan Stojanovski. I was born on 19th July, 2003 in Bitola, Macedonia. We are five siblings in the family, as I am the fifth and youngest child. Both of my parents are from Bitola, and that is how it happened to be that Bitola is my hometown and the place where I took my elementary and secondary education - at the High School gymnasium “Josip Broz Tito”. Being a member of a big family brought to the fun, diverse and “help-each-other” activities. Keeping in mind that Bitola has astonishing landscape surroundings, a good amount of the time I got to spend in rural context that is thanks to my parents. Other times were, as I would normally classify my generation, and maybe not far before – the gaming generation, which means spending good amount of time on the computer, yet not to out-shadow the outdoor activities which included Football most of the time. Bitola, as being not very big town, was an easy place to grow up in, when it comes to access of different necessary places and the friendly, cultural and social-wise character of it. I can say that I am happy to have been growing up in such a humble place.</p>
<p class="p">On 2022, it came the year where a decision was supposed to be made regarding my further-on studies, and therefore my bold decision directed my passions to the studies of Computer Science and Engineering. It was a moment of metamorphosing the computer from being a toy to being a tool, for greater good of course. The studies were successfully assigned at the Public University “Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje, to be precise – at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, and that is the moment of becoming a student, and as such, departed from my family and hometown. My further ambitions engage with the field of studies, with a hope and duty to participate in many projects in between for the purpose of attaining great knowledge. In other words, biography is yet to be written.</p>
